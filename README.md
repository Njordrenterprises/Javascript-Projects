# Njordr Enterprises Full Stack Web Development Roadmap

Welcome to the comprehensive roadmap at Njordr Enterprises, where I will develop and enhance my Full Stack Development skills. This plan is a commitment to mastering not only Deno and Golang but also security best practices and Bash scripting to automate and streamline development workflows.

## Learning Trajectory

- **Immediate Goals (0-3 months)**:
  - Refine advanced JavaScript ES6+ features and implement responsive designs with Tailwind CSS.
  - Begin my journey with Deno, focusing on its security-focused architecture.

- **Short-Term Objectives (4-6 months)**:
  - Dive deeper into Deno for creating secure server-side applications.
  - Start learning Golang with an emphasis on building efficient and secure backend services.
  - Initiate the practice of Bash scripting for automating repetitive tasks in my development process.

- **Mid-Term Ambitions (7-12 months)**:
  - Attain a solid command of Golang for system programming and backend development.
  - Establish a robust understanding of cybersecurity principles and apply them to my full-stack projects.
  - Develop advanced Bash scripts to manage and deploy applications with a focus on security automation.

- **Long-Term Vision (1-2 years and beyond)**:
  - Integrate comprehensive security measures into all layers of development, from frontend to backend.
  - Contribute to the Deno and Golang communities with a focus on enhancing security features.
  - Create a suite of Bash scripts and tools to automate security checks and deployment tasks.

## Project Development Timeline

The following projects will be the application of my growing skill set:
